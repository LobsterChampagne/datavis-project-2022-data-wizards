            <p>
                It's a lovely Friday evening and you're just home from a long day at work. You're finding yourself
                sitting
                on your couch with a cold beverage in one hand and the remote control in the other.
                You really feel like watching a movie or getting started on a new series.
                However, you're previous subscription just ran out and you feel like it's time for a change.
                So you're sitting there wondering; What streaming provider suits me the most?
                There are so many options!
            </p>
            <p>
                Choosing the correct streaming provider that suits you the best might be a challenging task.
                There is a lot of things to take into account and lots of question that needs to be addressed.
                Are you more into movies or series? What kind of movie categories do you like? What movies does your
                favorite actor star in?
                These are just a few out of many questions to take into consideration when choosing your
                streaming provider.
                If you are the kind of person that find yourself in this situation or you simply just
                don't know which streaming provider to chose? Then this website is perfect for you!
                The goal of this website and visualizations is to give you some
                insights and help you chose the most suitable and best streaming provider according to your preferences.

            <h1>Basic Overview</h1>
            <div class="text">
                <p>
                    This section gives you an idea of how many movies and TV shows that are available
                    on the four different services. As you can see Netflix and Prime have by far the biggest
                    amount of content. So if you just want the maximum amount of content, and don't really mind what you
                    watch you'll be fine with either Netflix and/or Prime. You can also play around with the visualization a bit, 
                    and you can see which of the providers that are best at adding new content to their platform.
                    Adding new content to the platform might be a key factor in determining to chose 
                    a certain streaming provider in favour of another. The amount of new content that 
                    a streaming provider adds to their platform is a indication of where things are going in 
                    terms of the amount of content that they would have avaliable in the future.
                </p>
            </div>

            </div>
    
            <div class="one-line center">
                <div style="display:block;">
                <input class="form-control" type="text" placeholder="Today (2022 + undated)" readonly id="year_txt">
                <input type="range" min="2000" max="2023" value="2023" class="slider" id="year_plot">

            </div>
            </div>
            <div class="info_text" id="info_year_select">
                Due to the data for Amazon Prime being incomplete, we decided to add the option to have the
                display the full data at the very end. Play around with the slider to get a feeling
                for the speed with which Netflix and co is growing.
            </div>
    
            <div class="text">
                <p>
                    From the barchart above you can see that Netflix has more TV-shows than the other providers.
                    Interestingly Hulu has a lot of TV-shows, and Prime is not beating them by much in regard to content.
                    Another interesting fact is that Hulu has a lot of TV-shows compared to the number
                    of movies available on the platform. So if you're the person that enjoys watching TV-shows,
                    but hate having to browse through endless of options (even though Netfliz and Prime 
                    provide filtering), then Hulu might be the right option as they might continue with this distribution.

                    Using this set of parameters you can set the minimal amount of movies an actor should have. Lower values
                    make the calculation slower and hence we recommend to use values above 5.
                    Also, it does not make sense to use a streaming provider just because of one move.

                    The Sankey-Diagram should help you to see, which streaming platform offers you

                    The Sankey diagram adapts to your choice, in that way you'll see which provider
